# CFHT 2021 Internship Project
 Telescope observation scheduling project
 
 The goal of the project is to develop a program that allows observers to see the
 observability period of an object that they are planning to study. The program will
 allow users to provide a date or range of dates, as well as the celestial coordinates
 of the object, and will be provided with the amount of time the object is visible within
 that range.
 
 The project will also be deliverable as a web tool. In this version of the program, the
 user will also be provided a graphical representation of the information. Currently, the
 plan is to have a graph of the visibility and location for a single day of observing.
